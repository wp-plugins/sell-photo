When you insert a photo gallery the shortcode will look like the following:

`[gallery link="file" ids="687,688,689,690,691,692"]`

All you need to do is add a "sell_photo" parameter so the plugin can create a Buy button for each photo of that particular gallery.

`[gallery link="file" ids="687,688,689,690,691,692" sell_photo="1"]`
