Sell images or photos on WordPress for free

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create a Buy button for each image of your WordPress photo gallery.

Once you have installed this plugin you need to go to the settings menu to configure some options (Settings -> Sell Photo).

* PayPal Email: Your PayPal email address
* Currency Code: The default currency code
* Price Amount: The default price of each gallery photo
* Button Text/Image: The text/image for the Buy button
* Return URL: The URL where a user will be redirected to after the payment

Now add a new post/page and create a WordPress gallery by uploading images.

The gallery shortcode will look similar to the following:

`[gallery link="file" ids="687,688,689,690,691,692"]`

All you need to do is add a "sell_photo" parameter so the plugin can create a Buy button for each photo of that particular gallery.

`[gallery link="file" ids="687,688,689,690,691,692" sell_photo="1"]`
